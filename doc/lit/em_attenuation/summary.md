Optical properties of the clearest natural waters (200-800 nm)

Well respected/cited article detailing IOP (and the derivation of IOPs from AOPs) of natural waters. The investigators used a UV submersible spectroradiometer to make measurements of the diffuse attenuation coefficient for irradiance, K(lambda), which is the most direct measure of the penetration of the radiant energy in ocean water. IOPs of pure water are important since they can be used to quantify the maximum penetration depth of light into natural waters. Radiative transfer theory can be used to infer the IOPs from the AOPs. It is important to note that the AOPs, like the IOPs, are dependent on dissolved and particulate material in the water in addition to the light distribution incident. An interesting finding that the inclusion of the particle backscattering coefficient, B * b_p^sw, would increase the diffuse attenuation coefficient, K_w^sw, by 6% in the 400-500nm region, 4% in the 350-440nm and 460-500nm region, any only a few percent in the reset of the spectrum. The article also outlines the following well known relationships between attenuation, absorption, and scattering:

> (c, total attenuation coeff) = (a, total absorption coeff) + (b, total scattering coeff)
> (a, total absorption coeff) = (a_w, absorption coeff for pure water) + (a_p, absorption coeff for particles) + (a_y, absorption coeff for dissolved organics)
> (b, total scattering coeff) = (b_m, molecular scattering coeff for pure water) + (b_p, molecular scattering coeff for particles)

  "Fig 1: Total absorption coefficient, a_w(lambda), of pure water as a function of wavelength. These results have been compiled by a variety of sources and generally show more agreement for longer wavelengths and some tension for shorter, near-UV wavelengths. This is consistent with many other studies of natural water IOPs. Note that this graph attempts to show the absorption coefficient for pure freshwater which does not contain absorption from particles or dissolved organic materials (yellow substance). However, this value should present apparent optical properties (AOPs) of the clearest natural waters."

Absorption and attenuation of visible and near-infrared light in water: dependence on temperature and salinity

The absorption coefficient was measured across 15 different wavelength of both pure water and saltwater in this study. A focus on how temperature and salinity effects on absorption as well as an attempt to characterize each affect linearly is presented a ways into the paper. Scattering and absorption are two major components that need to be understood to realize how light interacts with water. Generally, absorption measurements are difficult to take of visible wavelengths since light absorption in water is much lower in the region. 
Discussion included the molecular structure of water and why it is so strongly influenced by outside factors such as salinity and temperature (overtones of the O-H vibrational modes for wavelengths >450nm). Quick discussion/equations of the various components to be considered when determining the absorption coefficient (particulate matter, dissolved matter, reference water, scattering error) is also included. It was found that salinity (as well as temperature) only had a strong impact on the optical properties of water in the near-IR region of the spectrum. The absorption coefficient was found to decrease as salinity increases although these changes were not as pronounced as changes to the temperature of the water (except for the measurements taken at 412nm which had a strong salinity dependence).

For shorter wavelengths in the blue and near-UV spectrum regions, the discrepancy between results is believed to be due to contaminants such as dissolved organics in the water samples.

Absorption spectrum (340–640 nm) of pure water. I. Photothermal measurements

An attempt to measure the "purest available water" using photothermal techniques that are in theory free from any scattering effects over visible wavelengths. The scattering coefficient must include scattering events caused by suspended particulate matter as well as those caused by density fluctuations in the pure liquid (molecular). This study is unique that it (theoretically) does not have to correct for scattering corrections since it is measuring the absorption directly. This is of particular significant in the blue, near-UV regions of the spectrum. An interesting addition is the high-level diagrams of the photothermal detection circuitry using opamps, current buffers, and control feedback loops along with a detailed setup schematic (both of which are very high quality and are worth considering for future diagrams of this nature). This paper states Bouguer's law (also known as Beer-Lambert law) which eddies the effect the attenuation coefficient has on a source intensity and the transmitted intensity as a function of distance. This relation is as follows (where c(lambda) is the total extinction/attenuation coefficient as a function of wavelength):

> I = I_0 * exp( -c(lambda) * z )

Optical  classification  of  natural  waters

This article considers the diffuse attenuation coefficient for natural waters as a function of cholorophyll-like pigment concentration in the water. The affects that photoplankton have on light attenuation are shown at visible wavelengths over diverse oceanic environments. In unproductive (low phytoplankton carbon count) waters, the detrital particles (rock, minerals, sediment) have a dominant effect on the optical properties of oceanic waters. On a seperate note, dissolved organic material does not have a large effect on light attenuation except potentially in the blue to far-blue region of the spectrum. Additional conversation about measuring chlorophyll-like pigment concentrations using irradiance reflected measurements (i.e. from satellite imagery).

Optical properties of the "clearest" natural waters

This paper proposes yet another investigation into the Inherent Optical Properties (IOP) of natural waters. Specifically, this paper argues that although the article published by Smith and Baker in 1981 has merit and high agreement for most of the visible wavelengths, it my be overestimating absorption of shorter near-UV wavelengths. They use the extremely clear, blue-violet waters of the South Pacific Gyre near Easter Island with very low particulate absorption as their main argument from measurements they have taken. Additionally, they present data compiled from several investigators that may infer that absorption at these short visible wavelengths may be lower. They also make a point that the diffuse attenuation values for downward irradiance are distinctly below values measured by Tyler and Smith (1970) at Crater Lake, Oregon. In measuring, IOPs (scattering and absorption and refractive index) of pure seawater are able to be inferred from knowledge of the upward and downward irradiance. The absorption coefficient can be broken into three parts: a_tot = a_w (by water) + a_p (by particles) + a_y (by dissolved yellow substance).

Optical Properties of Pure Water and Pure Sea Water

Mentioned the source of the originator of the c=a+b equation, Jerlov (1968). The author goes into an extensive discussion of the the theoretical happenings of Rayleigh scattering and its origin. Scattering exists even in a pure medium because of the discontinuous structure of matter. The total scattering coefficient, b, is obtained by integrating the volume scattering function, B(theta) over all directions. Rayleigh's "molecular" theory criticisms are discussed and the Einstein-Smoluchowski theory is presented. This theory suggests that scattering is caused by random motion of molecules. Then, a fairly thorough description of why determination of the scattering coefficient for water is so difficult is presented. This includes the following three issues: extremely accurate calibration of the scattering meter, ambient light (large issue since water scatters much more weakly than other liquids), and the purification of water needed to obtain a pure sample (water is harder to purify than other liquids). The results give values for both the scattering function at 90 degrees, and the total scattering coefficient for visible wavelengths in pure water and pure sea water.
